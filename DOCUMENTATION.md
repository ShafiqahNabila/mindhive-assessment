## Part 6: Documentation and Instructions

### 1. **Setup Instructions**
   - Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the project locally, including installing dependencies, setting up the database, and running the backend and frontend servers.
   - Include a section on configuring environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).

### 2. **Key Technical Decisions**
   - **Web Scraping**: Explain why you chose `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` over other libraries like Scrapy or Selenium.
   - **Database**: Justify the choice of PostgreSQL and the schema design (e.g., tables for outlets, addresses, and operating hours).
   - **Geocoding**: Discuss why Google Maps API was chosen over alternatives like OpenStreetMap or Mapbox.
   - **Backend**: Explain why FastAPI was selected over Flask or Django, highlighting its asynchronous capabilities and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
   - **Frontend**: Justify the use of React and `react-leaflet` for map visualization, emphasizing their flexibility and ease of integration.
   - **Chatbot**: Describe the decision to use regex and simple NLP techniques for query handling, and mention potential future improvements with more advanced models.

### 3. **Architecture Overview**
   - Provide a high-level diagram of the system architecture, showing how the frontend, backend, database, and external APIs interact.
   - Explain the flow of data from scraping to storage, geocoding, and visualization.

### 4. **API Documentation**
   - Include detailed documentation for all API endpoints, including request/response examples and error handling.
   - Use tools like Swagger or Redoc to generate interactive API documentation.

### 5. **Frontend Documentation**
   - Document the frontend components, including how the map visualization works and how the search functionality is implemented.
   - Provide instructions for customizing the frontend (e.g., changing the map style or adding new features).

### 6. **Chatbot Documentation**
   - Explain how the chatbot functionality works, including how queries are parsed and matched to the data.
   - Provide examples of supported queries and how to extend the functionality.

### 7. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Document how to run tests for the backend and frontend.
   - Provide tips for debugging common issues (e.g., database connection errors, API rate limits).

### 8. **Deployment Instructions**
   - Provide instructions for deploying the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel).
   - Include details on setting up a production database, securing API keys, and configuring environment variables.

### 9. **Future Enhancements**
   - Suggest potential improvements, such as adding caching, implementing user authentication, or enhancing the chatbot with more advanced NLP models.

### 10. **FAQs**
   - Include a section with frequently asked questions and troubleshooting tips.
